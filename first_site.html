			 I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that wrote Lorem Ipsum, but I don't know, maybe it was. It could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be some wordsmith sitting on their bed that weights 400 pounds. Ok? You could see there was text coming out of her eyes, text coming out of her wherever. I was going to say something extremely rough to Lorem Ipsum, to its family, and I said to myself, "I can't do it. I just can't do it. It's inappropriate. It's not nice." Lorem Ipsum is unattractive, both inside and out. I fully understand why it’s former users left it for something else. They made a good decision.
